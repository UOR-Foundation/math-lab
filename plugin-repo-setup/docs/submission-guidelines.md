## Review Process

### Initial Review

Upon submission, plugins undergo an initial automated review:

1. **Structure validation**: Ensures the plugin follows the required structure
2. **Manifest validation**: Checks for required fields in manifest.json
3. **Security scan**: Scans for potential security issues
4. **Performance test**: Measures load time and resource usage

### Community Review

Community plugins undergo a community review period:

1. PR remains open for at least 7 days
2. Requires at least 2 approvals from community members
3. Any identified issues must be addressed

### Core Team Review

For official plugins, the core team conducts a detailed review:

1. Code quality and organization
2. Test coverage and quality
3. Documentation completeness
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Performance optimization

## Versioning

Plugins must follow semantic versioning:

- **Major version**: Breaking changes
- **Minor version**: New features, non-breaking
- **Patch version**: Bug fixes, non-breaking

## Publication

Once approved, plugins are:

1. Merged to the repository
2. Added to the plugin registry
3. Built and packaged in all required formats
4. Made available through the Math Lab dashboard

## Maintenance

Plugin authors are responsible for maintaining their plugins:

- Responding to bug reports
- Updating for compatibility with new Math Lab versions
- Addressing security issues promptly

Unmaintained plugins may be marked as deprecated or removed from the registry.
